# Vite Boilerplate

> Quickly bootstrap a new project with Vite Boilerplate.

This boilerplate contains all the tools you need to build a modern web app with TypeScript, React, Vite, Storybook and Express.  
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your project.

ESLint, stylelint, prettier, husky and lintstaged are configured to give you a solid development experience.

## Installing / Developing

First, [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Now you are ready to go:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies required to run the boilerplate.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Boom! These scripts run your server, client and storybook in development mode.

The default PORTS are:

- `3001` for the server
- `3000` for the client
- `6006` for the storybook

If you don't like to call all scripts at once, you can also run:

```shell
npm run server:dev
npm run client:dev
npm run storybook
```

You can configure the server port by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Creating a `.env` file is supported. You can copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

| KEY  | VALUE                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT | (Optional) Port for the server environment (defaults to 3001) |

## Building

To build the project, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will build the client, server and storybook.

```shell
npm start
```

In production, you have a single server serving everything.

`/api/*` is the API endpoint.  
`/storybook` is the Storybook.  
`/*` is the client.

## Tests

This will test your code for possible errors.

```shell
npm run lint
```

This will fix found errors.

```shell
npm run lint-fix
```

TypeScript, linter and prettier are checked on commit thanks to husky and lintstaged.
